  <title>Topic Based Writing in LwDITA</title>
  <body>
    <p>LwDITA is a much simpler version of full DITA.  The goals of LwDITA relate to usability - the simpler the the situation, the better it is for LwDITA! </p>
    <p>What makes LwDITA so simple?  You can only write with two main content models of full DITA.
      <ol>
        <li>Maps</li>
        <li>Topics</li>
      </ol> 
    </p>
    <p>The actual elemental structure of LwDITA slightly changes compared to regular DITA.  Check out our "elements" section to learn about these difference!</p>
