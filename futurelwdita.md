# Future of LwDITA

The future of DITA is heavily focused on usability. Coders and developers are continuously looking for ways to make authoring easier for users and businesses nationwide. Thus, Lightweight DITA has become the answer. DITA, for the most part, has reached its capacity in terms of how many elements, topics, and capabilities it contains.

Lightweight DITA is in the process of catching up. Developers, in the coming years, would like for Lightweight DITA to encompass more while keeping things simple and easy to understand for novice users.
