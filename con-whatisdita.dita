 <conbody>
  <p>In 2001, IBM created an XML-based authoring tool to help them organize their technical information content into effective deliverables for online product help and support. The company kept this tool as an internal feature until it was donated as an "open source architecture" and version 1 was released in 2005. Three more versions - 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 - were released in 2007, 2010, and 2014, respectively.  </p>
