  <p>DITA - or, Darwin Information Typing Architechture - is an XML-based authoring tool used to create and publish technical information into effective deliverables for an audience. In a technical world, content created on things like Microsoft Word, email, WordPress, or even HTML is not able to be used and re-used effectively in the future, making the content ineffeicient and costing your team time and money that they shouldn't have to spend.</p>
