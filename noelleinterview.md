# Interview with Scriptorium Publishing Intern

Noelle has experience in the professional world as an editor, publisher, and technical writer! We asked her a few questions to provide you, the reader, with a unique perspective on technical writing in the workplace, as well as some additional information about DITA and Lightweight DITA.

**Interviewer**: What is your major, what are your career interests, and what sort of experience do you have using DITA?

**Noelle**: Professional and Technical Writing, Pre-Law; publishing and editing; DITA experience in Creating User Docs class and internship with Scriptorium Publishing.

**Interviewer**: What duties does your internship entail, and what role does DITA play in your internship?

**Noelle**: At my internship with Scriptorium, I help write online content for their Learning DITA classes. Their LearningDITA site provides free courses to help users learn DITA. My role was offering comments on the course content and writing some content myself including assessment questions. In the last one we released, the course was about publishing content, so I wrote part of the topic on how to install Java on a Mac so that it can run the DITA OT (Open Toolkit).

**Interviewer**: Why do you like using Lightweight DITA? How often do you use it in your work and what are some pros and cons of using it?

**Noelle**: I don't really use Lightweight DITA for my internship, but what I remember from Creating User Docs was that it condensed information in a way that made it easier and more accessible. That class focused on usability and DITA itself and that's really helped. A con of Lightweight DITA is that there are limited resources online to help so the majority of what I know about it came from Dr. Evia.
