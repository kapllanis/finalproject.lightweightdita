  <title>Linking In Lightweight DITA</title>
  <shortdesc>There are several different types of links available for use to help with retrivability
    and easy navigation of your content. These links include hiearchial links, inline links, related
    links, and collection type links.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <section>
      <title>Hierarchial Links</title>
      <p>These nested topics reveal the navigation of information through a topic hierarchy: parent,
        child, and sibling topics. They are automatically linked to each other by creating this type
        of link. <image id="hierarchiallinks"/></p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Inline Links</title>
      <p> These type of links connect users to related information by being inserted in the text of
        the topic. This is done by using the &lt;xref> element. <image id="inlinelinks"/></p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Related Links</title>
      <p>These links are inserted in a relationship table. Because these links are less common and
        harder to create, see Chapter 7 in the text referenced below to if you need to learn more
        about them. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Collection Type Links</title>
      <p>These type of links are set in the DITA map because they create links among a group of
        nested topics. You can apply this attriubte on &lt;topicref> and &lt;topicgroup> elements in
        a DITA map. For more information on sequence, choice, unordered, and family collection
        types, see Chapter 7 in the text referenced below.  </p>
